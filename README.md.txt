so basically in my line of work as a technician in the automotive industry, we get paid by the things we do.
However, sometimes those things(tickets) are not closed out in the same day or sometimes week and we end up with hours lost on a paycheck. To better monitor this activity to see who is doing this and how often since the software we use does not, I made a program that you use side by side as you're working with whatever software the dealership uses. V1 Is very simple, enter the day, and ticket information, and whenever you get done with the tickets for the week, you can go back and see who was on time closing and paying you for your tickets, and who did not. V1 is not done quite yet, I still need to learn how to save it to the SSD of the computer
